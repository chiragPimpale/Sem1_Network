    <li>VPN stands for Virtual Private Network</li>
    <li>VPNs send traffic between two or more devices on a network in an encrypted tunnel</li>
    <li>When a VPN connection is made, all of the network traffic is encrypted on the clients end, sent over the network to a host, and decrypted creating a tunnel between two devices</li>
    <li>The client's machine will virtually be a part of the remote network</li> </ul>
